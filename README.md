# PRODIGY_ML_02 - Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project is part of the **Machine Learning Internship** offered by **Prodigy InfoTech**.

---

## 📊 Task Objective

Implement a **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on:

- **Annual Income** (`Annual Income (k$)`)
- **Spending Score** (`Spending Score (1-100)`)

📌 Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Customer Segmentation Tutorial in Python](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab

---

## 📈 Approach

- Loaded and cleaned the dataset  
- Analyzed distributions of income and spending score  
- Applied the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters  
- Trained a **K-Means Clustering** model  
- Visualized customer clusters using scatter plots  
- Interpreted segmentation results

---

## ✅ Results

- **Optimal Clusters Identified**: `5`  
- Customers segmented into distinct groups based on income and spending behavior  
- Visual analysis revealed meaningful clusters representing different customer profiles
